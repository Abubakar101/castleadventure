##What is Castle Adventure?
- Castle Adventure is an old freeware/shareware DOS game. Built in 1984 by teenaged programmer Kevin Bales, it quickly spread. Today, it still occupies a place of fond nostalgia for many of us who started playing computer games in the DOS era, but has never been replicated fully for the modern internet browser.
